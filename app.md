# Problem

The rise in comfort and luxury levels over the years has been synonymous with a rise in waste production and environmental degradation. One of the key issues faced by humanity in todayâ€™s world is the increasing levels of waste production and greenhouse gases, and the resultant negative impact of the same on the ecosystem including rising sea levels, global warming, and air pollution. Given conditions necessitate strong, efficient, and immediate actions to mitigate the issue and stabilise future emissions. Knowing there is an issue, however, is not enough. To combat this rise in global production of waste and greenhouse gases, first, there is a need to classify them and segregate them in order to prevent massive landfills which can be achieved if we take out the recyclable waste out of the equation.

## Model

### [Inception-Resnet-V2](https://keras.io/api/applications/inceptionresnetv2/)

Inception-ResNet-v2 is a convolutional neural network that is trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database. The network is 164 layers deep and can classify images into 1000 object categories, such as keyboard, mouse, pencil, and many animals.

## Dataset

### [Trashnet]("https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jvapC-43bm_-PeoIAaaJkdFDIKDLfHLN?usp=sharing")

This dataset contains 2522 images of trash items. The images are grouped into 6 classes. These classes represent various trash items. Each class contains rgb images.
